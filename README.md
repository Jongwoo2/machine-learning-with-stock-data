# machine-learning-with-stock-data
This is a ML model built using [S&P 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies) stock data. S&P 500 stock data are pulled using [Yahoo-Finance API](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/yahoo-finance1?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=1674315309_77004833236&utm_term=yahoo%20finance%20api_e&utm_content=1t1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIwrmtmMro5QIVASUrCh3MFAIvEAAYASAAEgIejfD_BwE)

## Getting Started
This is a Python based project and I highly recommend you to use [Anaconda platform](https://www.anaconda.com/) since it allows you to handle python modules with ease. 

### Prerequisites
1. A decent Python platform with fundamental Python Knowledge
2. Basic API knowledge
3. Python Modules
   - Numpy
   - Pandas
   - Pandas-datareader
   - Matplotlib
   - BeautifulSoup4
   - sklearn (scikit-learn)
   - yfinance (yahoo-finance)
